Statistics is the mathematical science behind the problem “what can I know
about a population if I’m unable to reach every member?”

 Data = the collected observations we have about something.
● Data can be continuous: "What is the stock price?"
● or categorical: "What car has the best repair history?"

Why Data:
"What relationships if any exist between two events?"
"Do people who eat an apple a day enjoy fewer doctor's visits than those who don't?"
"Based on a user's click history which ad is more likely to bring them to our site?"
