1. What is linear regression, and how does it work?
A. Linear Regression is a model - find the prediction value(Real Value), it will find the relationship between dependent varaibles vs one or more independent varaibles.
It is called "linear" because the model assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables.


Linear regression can be classified into two types: 
- Simple Linear Regression - (one independent variable)
- Multiple Linear Regression - (more than one independent variables)

In linear regression, a line of best fit is plotted on a scatter plot of the data points.

Linear regression can be used for both continuous and categorical dependent variables 

2. What are the assumptions of a linear regression model?
A. 1. Linear relatioship between dependent varaibles vs Independent varaibles using scaller plots
   2. Input varaibles/features should be Indepenent 
   3. There is no multicolinearity between input varaibles - by conductinong VIF Test
   4. errors should follow the normal distribution using q-q plots
   5. errors are not auto corelated - confirm using durban-wasten test
   6. errors should matain constant varaince


3. What are outliers? How do you detect and treat them? How do you deal with outliers in a linear regression model?
A. 1. Outiers is data points fall on the extream  / far away the median value . will pull the mean on the two extream ends
   2. Using Box-Plots and IQR Methods - we can find the outliers.
   3. Outliers will increase the errors after model predection.
   4. MSE, RMSE will increase due to outliers 
 

4. How do you determine the best fit line for a linear regression model?
A. 1. y= b0+b1x1+b2x2+b3x3 ... we can find the coeffiecnets (b0 -  intercept / lift the line) (b1,b2,b3 - slople - rotate the line)
   2. Find the cost function , by minimizing the error (by doing the first order differentation equate to 0 , find the coeffieents), we will find the best fit line.

5. What is the difference between simple and multiple linear regression?
A. Simple:


9. What are the common types of errors in linear regression analysis?
A. 1. Overfit
   2. Underfit
   3. Outliers
   4. Multicollinearity
   5. No Linear Relationship
   6. Non-linearity of the residuals

13. How do you measure the strength of a linear relationship between two variables?
A. 1. Using scallet plot
   2. corelation coefficient

16. What are the common techniques used to improve the accuracy of a linear regression model?
A. 1. Feature Selection
   2. Feature Scaling
   3. Feature Transformation
   4. Regularization

19. What are the assumptions of the ordinary least squares method for linear regression?
